# Give the string of the file path on your computer to the file of data you want to examine

# the data
# The first part is the file path, which here is name
# the second part explains how the data is separated. For instance, with this file, the different values of data
# on a line are separated by a space. For a csv file, one would probably write: sep=',' instead
